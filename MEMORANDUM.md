## CAPS Curriculum Alignment

This assessment covers the following Grade 5 CAPS Mathematics topics:

### Space and Shape (Geometry)

**2D Shapes:**
- Recognize, visualize, and name 2D shapes (triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, octagons, circles)
- Describe and classify 2D shapes based on their properties (sides, angles, equal sides)
- Understand relationships between different shapes (e.g., squares are special rectangles)

**3D Objects:**
- Recognize, visualize, and name 3D objects (cubes, rectangular prisms, cylinders, cones, spheres, pyramids, prisms)
- Describe 3D objects in terms of faces, vertices (corners), and edges
- Count and compare the number of faces, vertices, and edges in different 3D objects

**Symmetry:**
- Identify and draw lines of symmetry in 2D shapes
- Recognize shapes with multiple lines of symmetry
- Understand that some shapes have more lines of symmetry than others

---

## Teaching Notes

### Common Errors to Look For:

1. **Confusing 2D shapes with 3D objects** - Remind learners that 2D shapes are flat (like drawings), while 3D objects are solid (like real objects you can hold)

2. **Difficulty counting faces/edges/vertices** - Use physical models or drawings to help learners visualize and count systematically

3. **Symmetry misconceptions** - Use folding paper activities to demonstrate lines of symmetry physically

4. **Shape naming** - Practice spelling and pronunciation of shape names regularly

### Remediation Strategies:

- **Score 0-14 marks (Below 50%):** Intensive intervention needed. Use concrete manipulatives, real-world examples, and one-on-one support.

- **Score 15-20 marks (50-69%):** Additional practice needed. Focus on specific weak areas identified in the assessment.

- **Score 21-30 marks (70-100%):** Satisfactory understanding. Provide enrichment activities and extension work.

When a learner incorrectly identifies a pyramid's faces, the game instantly flags the error and (in more advanced versions) could show why, thus closing the learning loop far quicker than traditional paper-based tests.
